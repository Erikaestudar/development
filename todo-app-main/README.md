## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- JSON

### What I learned

I learned a lot from this project, I often thought about giving up on it. Because I started studying JavaScript while I was trying to do this. It was a very big challenge for me, between research and studies, the code often didn't work, I used AI for better targeting, and this is the result. A lot of JS code was the first time I came across it, like JSON, drag and drop.

### Continued development

I intend to continue learning more and more.

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxP4jZQY0h4&t=2783s) - This helped me to make JSON.
