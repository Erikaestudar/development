## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

```css
body {
    background-color: hsl(212, 45%, 89%);
    font-family: "Outfit", sans-serif;
    width: 100vw;
    height: 100vh;

    margin: auto;
    display: flex;
    flex-flow: column wrap;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
}
```

### Continued development

I want to continue to improve HTML and CSS more and more, learn JavaScript.

### Useful resources
